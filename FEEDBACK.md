8/28/14, Test Tube Meetup

Tester #1

- Surprised at all the info that pops up when you click a clock, thought it was just the time
- For the weather, it's not clear what time it's for - now? tomorrow? some other time?
- Curious about where the news is coming from
- Confused about the background photo - the city clicked on didn't match the city in the photo
- Thought flickr pics were cool
- Curous about where the content comes from
- Didn't know you could add cities, didn't have twitter
- For the articles, didn't feel like reading them now, more in the mindset of browsing
- Confused by the 'saved' text in pics
- He explored and found the saved pics in the dashboard
- He's not great at reading analog clocks, the clocks are hard to read
- Thought 'read later' for articles was 'read now', you'd click it and read it then
- doesn't like being sent to a new tab when clicking content
- 'Read later' could be cool if synced to something else, like an app or email or something 
- Feels like so much info
- Could add restaurants, things to do, maybe more than just pics and tweets and articles
- Not super interesting content, but good overall for exploring a city if bored
- Likes the overall design
- Thought a forecast for weather would be more useful than just the current weather

Tester #2

- Liked seeing Celsius for the weather
- For the background photos, asked if it was always day or night, or if they changed depending on the time
- Like how the articles went directly to the NYT site
- Liked how the articles opened in a new tab
- Didn't realize it was news about the city, thought it was more touristy pieces at first
  * maybe add more touristy stuff - shopping, food?
- Wanted the weather to be more animated
- "If I went to Paris, I wouldn't care about news" - wanted more touristy stuff
- For photos, thought it could be cool to show them as a pin drop on a map of where they were taken 
- Liked the top tweets and the 'like' button
- Liked our faces at the bottom of the page, made it more personable
- Maybe include a 'fun' tab for fun stuff?
- News for London had no images, just text - seemed 'blah'
- Initial thoughts - saw the water (weather icon was raining) and thought it was informational
  - Like if it's raining, it would say 'bring an umbrella' or something
- Wanted a way to find the info on a location in the pics (I pointed them to the picture's flickr page, but they still insisted)
- Not sure why we have top tweets
- Doesn't have twitter so didn't think to log in
- Can't read the clock at the top, too abstract analog style

Tester #3

- Thought there was more below the clocks at first (before clicking one)
- Likes how news articles open in a new tab
- There was more news than she would read at once - would be 1-3 articles at best
- Photos were a nice touch
- Touristy photos might not appeal if the user traveled a lot for business
- Likes top tweets
- Would have liked to see the clocks again at the bottom so you don't have to scroll back up to do another city
- Didn't realize the background was the same picture every time at first
- Saw a twitter bug - if there are no character breaks for a long string, it overflows out of the div
- Would like a filter for the time or weather (?)
- "If you log in with twitter, what does it do?"
  * Should add text saying you can add cities if you log in, make the value of logging in clear
- Asked if you can delete cities
- Thought it would be a good homepage, or a great chrome extension
- "Read later - oh cool! Where did that go?"
  * Need to make it clearer where the articles are being saved
- Asked if you can favorite the tweets in twitter as well as 'like' them
- Button that says 'dashboard' would be useful
- Share or email buttons for sharing media would be good (can use a mailto instead of sending anonymous emails)
- 'I'm always 
- Thought it was a very clean design

Tester #4

- 'Weather wow, this is so awesome'
- Want to see current location bigger (it's small in the top left corner)
- Weather could be smaller to allow room for current location
- News is 'really cool'
  - "I would probably read some of this stuff"
- Having a band above photos, it's too narrow
- Loves the photos
- Thought to see more of similar pics when they clicked on them (takes you to flickr page)
- Didn't know it went to flickr when clicking a photo - would have been annoyed
- Not sure where 'it's going' with the info
  - Would have liked to see some differentiation betwen districts where the pictures were taken
- "It's great, like a stream of consciousness"
- About page - eye doesn't know where to go
  - Maybe have in a bigger link to the text? (?)
- Not clear that the big X would close the modal for the about page
- 'Would be good to have different pics for each city' referring to background pics
- Thought to categorize news
  - 'Business or pleasure experience, or both'
- Thought it's 'really really lovely', but needs clarification
- When logging in, cool to add info about yourself - number of miles you travel per year
- Didn't see the login button at all

Tester #5

- Weather was 'exactly what I thought would come up'
- 'Oh that's way cool'
- 'Why popular photos?'
  - Not so interested in touristy pics if traveling for work
  - Think more useful things are more important than photos
- Very easy to use
- Maybe connect your flight information if traveling
- Couldn't find login button, but asked if could login
- Searched for Sao Paulo and it said it wasn't listed
  * Fix that bug
- Asked how you can delete a city
- Maybe have different background pics for each city?
- Current location not clear enough for current city
- Weather - maybe forecast instead of right now
- 'There needs to be something else to make me want to use this'
- Likes the news for cities
  - Flight info would be good
  - Maybe traffic if going from the flight to a hotel or meeting
- Definitely a forecast for weather instead of current conditions
- Don't need photos
