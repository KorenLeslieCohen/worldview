QUEENS JS TALK

  - background on the making of the site
    - quick background info on us (non-coding backgrounds to flatiron)
    - had a week to do a new project
    - started with the idea of presenting news headlines, evolved to add more apis and functionalty
  - demo the site
    - click city, see each api
    - log in, add city, find new content
    - save content to the db
  - process of developing it
    - worked through getting basic api calls in through ajax, site ui was rough
    - lost a day struggling with yahoo boss before switching to nyt
    - main tasks: getting ui to not suck, getting content to not suck
    - iterated on ui design before going to bootstrap, ended up replicating the theme in css
    - news
      - got decent content, but for smaller cities would have nothing
      - needed to set up fallback to country/state, aka 'bigger thing'
      - also needed to stagger articles on the page so the most recent stories are at the top, instead of left column to right column
    - pictures
      - got okish content, but needed to get better and also present it in a uniform way
      - lots of iterations to 
    - tweets
      - lots of upfront integration issues
      - similar fallback mechanism for city and bigger thing
      - big problem was perserving links and hashtag links
      - also iterating on the ui design for presentation
    - takeaways:
      - when the design isn't final, hard to say how the backend should be set up
      - when both back and frontend are being developed simultaneously, have to be ready to adjust one or both 
      - finding the focus for what this should be helped guide us to a better direction
    - future:
      - implement some feedback
      - expand on features
      - address known issues (full mobile responsiveness, huge resource usage)
